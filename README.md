This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in Ada programming related to exception handling.  The `bug.ada` file contains code that attempts to prevent a division by zero error, but fails to do so completely. The `bugSolution.ada` file presents a corrected version.  This example highlights the importance of robust error handling and shows how seemingly safe checks may not always prevent runtime errors in Ada.  Understanding Ada's exception handling is crucial for writing reliable and secure software.
